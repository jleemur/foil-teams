# Fredericton Open's Invitational League (FOIL)

This codebase contains a set of Google Sheets macros that automatically build teams based on attendance, seasonal win/loss records, and player skill ratings — all with a single click.

It solves the constant headache of last-minute attendance changes or players showing up unannounced. The goal is simple: confirm who’s in once we’re at the gym, run the macro, and generate fair, balanced teams on the spot.

## What is needed
- **Attendance sheet (public)**: Here you can view players attending, and a history of win/loss throughout the season.
- **Master sheet (private)**: Here you can view a hidden skill level per player used to help balance teams.
